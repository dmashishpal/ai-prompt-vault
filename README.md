# AI Prompt Vault 🔐

AI Prompt Vault is a simple, personal library of high-quality prompts for ChatGPT and other AI tools.  
The goal is to have one clean place to save, search, and reuse your best prompts.

## 🎯 Purpose

I use AI a lot for:
- Writing content
- Coding help
- Learning new concepts
- Social media & marketing ideas

Instead of losing good prompts in random chats, this project stores them in a structured, reusable format.

## 🧩 Features (Planned)

- ✅ List of prompts grouped by category
- ✅ Each prompt has:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Full prompt text
  - Tags (e.g. `#coding`, `#instagram`, `#study`)
- 🔍 Simple search/filter by category or tag
- 📁 Prompts stored in a JSON/Markdown file
- 🌐 Web UI to browse prompts

## 🛠 Tech Stack (for v1)

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (vanilla)
- (Optional later: React, localStorage, backend, etc.)
